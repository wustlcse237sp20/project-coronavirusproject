# cse237-project
What user stories were completed this iteration?
 
As a collective, the goal for this project was to allow people to be aware of the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we were aware that everyone has been keeping up with the corona virus progressions and its outreach, our team believed that there was a lack of actual knowledge of the spread of the virus. 
 
For this iteration, we decided to create the very basic foundation of this project. We aimed to achieve a platform for the user to be able to retrieve information about COVID-19â€™s effects and spread throughout the world. With our project, we are able to provide the user instant real time data of the total number of cases that have been recorded worldwide by country. The platform has an impeccable user interface which was designed to keep the environment user-friendly and simple. Upon running the project the user will observe a pop up window which prompts the user to type in a search box. Here the user will be allowed to type in a name of a country. Next to the search box is a button which upon a click event will output a print statement that will inform the user about the current reported cases of the particular country that the user typed in.
 
We successfully completed several user stories:
 
Each group member was able to make their own branch successfully, and spent this iteration getting comfortable with the different ways of handling and manipulating code through these branches.  
 
To make an interactive user interface, we made use of buttons that would refresh the data that has been loaded on the pop-up window to reflect the latest data available.
 
Functionality and logic added to our project to pull the most up-to-date information from an API regarding COVID-19 that reflects very accurately with real world information on it.
 
Buttons were added to enhance the layout of the pop-up window and to make the appearance more user friendly. Buttons also have the functionality that allows the user to select the country to be displayed.
 
Search bar has been added to allow easy look up of the desired country for the user.
 
Query API for countries statistic and store in global class so that it can be further manipulated for future iterations.
 
Added 8 test cases which check whether the information is being successfully accessed and retrieved from an API or not, and further checks whether the retrieved information from the API is accurate or not. 
 
What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
 
Check for invalid input and display the correct outputs guiding the user about how to correctly input into the search box.
 
Successfully run the project from the command line as instructed in the guidelines.

Add reported cures by Country.
 
Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
 
We intended to implement the start functionality of the project from the command line before the end of this iteration. However, due to the limitation of time we were not able to complete this user story. An executive decision was made and it was decided to push this to the next iteration. Thus, no implementation for this user story took place.
